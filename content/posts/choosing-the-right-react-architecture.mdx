In the early days of React, the Single Page Application (SPA) was the default. Today, frameworks like Next.js and Remix have popularized Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG), making the decision-making process more complex but also more powerful.

Choosing the right strategy is the difference between a site that feels "instant" and one that loses users to a loading spinner.

## 1. Single Page Application (SPA)

In an SPA, the server sends a "skeleton" HTML file and a large JavaScript bundle. The browser downloads the JS, which then builds the entire UI on the client side.

- **Best for:** Highly interactive applications where the user stays on one page for a long time (e.g., Dashboards, SaaS tools, Email clients).

- **Pros:** Rich, fluid transitions between views.
  - **Reduces server load** (the user's computer does the rendering).
  - **Simplified development** for internal tools.

- **Cons:** SEO Challenges: Search engine crawlers struggle to "read" content that hasn't rendered yet.
  - **Slow Initial Load:** The user sees a blank screen or spinner while the JS bundle downloads.

## 2. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

With SSR, the server generates the full HTML for a page on every single request. The browser receives a complete document that it can display immediately.

- **Best for:** Social media feeds, e-commerce product listings, and personalized dashboards that require SEO.

- **Pros:** Excellent SEO: Search engines see the content immediately.
  - **Fast Initial Paint:** Users see content much faster than in an SPA.
  - **Always Fresh:** Since it renders on every request, the data is never stale.

- **Cons:** Server Cost: Every request requires the server to "work," which can be expensive at scale.
  - **Latency**: There is a slight delay while the server builds the page before sending it.

## 3. Static Site Generation (SSG)

SSG creates the HTML files for every page at build time (when you deploy). These files are then served via a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

- **Best for:** Blogs, documentation, marketing sites, and landing pages.

- **Pros:** Extreme Performance: Serving a static file from a CDN is the fastest way to deliver web content.
  - **Security:** There is no "live" database connection on the frontend to exploit.
  - **Cheapest Hosting:** Static files cost almost nothing to host.

- **Cons:** Stale Data: To update a typo or a price, you usually have to trigger a new build.
  - **Build Times:** If you have 100,000 pages, your build process can take a very long time.

## The Modern Compromise: Hybrid Approaches

You don't have to choose just one. Modern frameworks allow for a Hybrid Strategy:

- SSG for your landing page and blog (Speed + SEO).

- SSR for your dynamic search results (SEO + Fresh Data).

- SPA for the logged-in user dashboard (Interactivity).

**Pro Tip:** Look into Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR). It allows you to use SSG but tells the server to "re-bake" the static page in the background every X minutes, giving you the speed of static with the freshness of SSR.
